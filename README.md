# ⚛️ Learning React.js – Projects & Practice

This repository documents my journey of **learning React.js** by understanding core concepts and building hands-on projects. The goal is to strengthen my front-end development skills through consistent practice and real-world UI implementations.

📌 What I’m Learning

I’m focusing on the core concepts of React.js to build a strong foundation and write clean, maintainable code.

⚛️ React Fundamentals
Understanding how React works, the component-based architecture, and how the UI updates efficiently using the virtual DOM.

🧩 Components & JSX
Creating functional components using JSX to structure and render UI elements in a clear and readable way.

📥 Props (Data Flow)
Passing data between components using props to make components dynamic, reusable, and configurable.

🧠 State Management (useState)
Managing component-level state to handle user interactions and dynamic UI updates.

🔁 Side Effects (useEffect)
Handling side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, and lifecycle-like behavior in functional components.

🪝 React Hooks
Learning how hooks allow functional components to manage state, side effects, and logic without using class components.
Understanding when and why to use hooks like useState and useEffect, and how they help keep components simple and readable.

♻️ Reusable & Modular Components
Designing components that can be reused across the application to reduce duplication and improve scalability.

📂 Project Structure & Best Practices
Organizing files and folders properly, writing clean code, and following React best practices for real-world applications.
